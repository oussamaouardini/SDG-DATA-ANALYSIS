The emergence of Corona Virus disease (COVID-19) has led the world to an unprecedented public health crisis, which affected the lives of all sections of society as people were asked to self-quarantine in their homes to prevent the spread of the virus. The lockdown had serious implications on mental health, resulting in psychological problems including frustration, stress, and depression.

The students from the less privileged backgrounds have experienced larger negative impacts due to the Covid-19 outbreak such as Reduction in family income, limited access to digital resources, and the high cost of internet connectivity have disrupted the academic life of the students. Moreover, changes in daily routine including lack of outdoor activity, disturbed sleeping patterns, social distancing have affected the mental well-being of the students.

In this project, we investigated and analyzed the potential consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the life of students. Moreover, our study attempts to assess the mental situation of students of different age groups using different parameters including sleeping habits, daily fitness routine, and social support.

At the first point we started looking for the dataset especially who is realated to the students life with COVID-19, as we found it in this kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/kunal28chaturvedi/covid19-and-its-impact-on-students

This dataset represents COVID-19'impact on education, social life and mental health of students & also the students' behaviour when they are in the lockdown 2020.

We choosed the topic of education and the impact of covid-19 pandemic on it as the enforced restrictions have harshly affected educational sectors in almost whole countries around the world. With a lot of students away from normal school life, the crisis threatens the teaching and learning processes and the studentsâ€™ emotional health.

and as the fourth goal of SDGs is: SDG 4: Quality Education

we consider analysing the mental health of students & their process learning as a mandatory process to discover the Impact of Covid 19 on students, & also as we consider

That the best anti poverty program is world class education
Education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world
